`card_deck.c` : This is the C file for the card deck problem. To run the program, download the Makefile. Then cd into the folder into which you download it. Type `make` in the terminal. Once the program is compiled, type `./card_deck NUM_CARDS` in the terminal, with `NUM_CARDS` being a number representing the number of cards that you want to play the game for. This will run the program for `NUM_CARDS` number of cards, and the program will print out the final deck and number of rounds played to the terminal. 

`cardDeck.py`: This is a python program I wrote for my own benefit. It does the same thing as the card_deck.c file. If you want to run this program, type `python cardDeck.py NUM_CARDS` in the terminal (being in the current folder).

`debug.c`: This file has the C file that I was asked to provide feedback for. My feedback is in the form of comments in the program. 

`FIR_Filters.pdf`: This is a write-up summarizing my work for the final question about FIR filters.
